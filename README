AnyCmd is a Total Commander lister plugin that permits redirect standard output
and error streams of any program to Total Commander lister view.

Inspired by AnyELF Total Commander plugin <http://anyelf.sourceforge.net>,
an idea came – why limit yourself with a special file formats only.
Why not permit to user define a custom dumper, text filter, lister or file viewer?
After all, there are a lot of command line text processing utilities that
already do this job. Definitely, you may use file associations or just use
command line window for this purpose. But, would not be it is just great if you
could do the job within Total Commander itself? I mean - do anything!
You can sort lines of text, compile a program, launch your favorite
Perl (really, Perl?) script, and so on.

Installation

Download the wlx_anycmd.zip file and save it in a temporary location.
Open Total Commander, locate the file and double click on it
(or just press “ENTER”). Total Commander will prompt you to install the plugin.
Accept it. A list of installed plugins will appear. Just press “OK”. That is all.

More instractions can be found in the 'doc' folder of the source package.
